SmaRM System - Algorithms and Software Engineering Features
=====================================================

1. SCHEDULE CONFLICT DETECTION ALGORITHM
---------------------------------------
Implementation Location: handle_schedule_request.php

Algorithm Description:
- Uses a three-condition overlap detection system
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of existing schedules
- Space Complexity: O(1)

Code Implementation:
```php
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM approved_requests 
WHERE room_number = ? AND schedule_date = ? 
AND (
    (start_time < ? AND end_time > ?) OR  // Complete overlap
    (start_time >= ? AND start_time < ?) OR  // Start time overlap
    (end_time > ? AND end_time <= ?)  // End time overlap
)
```

Key Features:
1. Complete Overlap Detection
   - Checks if new schedule completely contains an existing schedule
   - Prevents double-booking of entire time slots

2. Partial Overlap Detection
   - Validates if new schedule starts during an existing schedule
   - Ensures no schedule starts while another is in progress

3. End Time Overlap Detection
   - Verifies if new schedule ends during an existing schedule
   - Prevents schedule conflicts at the end of time slots

2. CALENDAR GENERATION ALGORITHM
-------------------------------
Implementation Location: room.php

Algorithm Description:
- Dynamic calendar generation with event markers
- Time Complexity: O(1) for month generation

Key Features:
1. Month Generation
   - Calculates first and last day of month
   - Determines correct starting day
   - Generates calendar grid

2. Event Marking

3. SCHEDULE FILTERING ALGORITHM
------------------------------
Implementation Location: room.php
